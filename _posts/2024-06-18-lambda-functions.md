# What is a lambda function?
A lambda function is a small, anonymous function that can be defined inline within a larger expression. It is a shorthand way to create small, one-time use functions. Lambda functions are often used when you need a small, short-lived function that doesn't need to be reused.


# What is a serverless function?
A serverless function is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and dynamically allocates compute resources as needed. The user only writes and runs the code, without worrying about the underlying infrastructure Serverless functions are often used for tasks that require a short-lived, stateless, and scalable execution environment.

# How I use lambda functions in a serverless architecture?
Lambda functions are a key component of serverless architectures. Here are some ways to use lambda functions in a serverless architecture:
1. **Event-driven architecture**: Lambda functions can be triggered by events such as changes to a database
2. **API Gateway**: Lambda functions can be used as the backend for API Gateway, handling HTTP requests and returning responses
3. **Real-time data processing**: Lambda functions can be used to process real-time data streams
4. **Scheduled tasks**: Lambda functions can be used to run scheduled tasks, such as daily or weekly reports
5. **Image and video processing**: Lambda functions can be used to process images and videos, such as resizing or transcoding
6. **Chatbots and conversational interfaces**: Lambda functions can be used to handle user input and generate responses
