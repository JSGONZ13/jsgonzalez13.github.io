# Context
Building and maintaining `data pipelines` can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex data sources, diverse data formats, high data volumes, and changing business requirements. This is why many developers choose Python for data: its flexibility.


It doesnâ€™t stop with just `Python`. You're also responsible for managing the infrastructure that runs your workflows, including servers, networks, storage, and security, which can be costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. And not to mention complex.


# What is serverless architecture?
Serverless architecture is a software design pattern where applications are built without the need to manage servers or infrastructure.
Instead, the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and dynamically allocates computing resources as needed. This approach allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
